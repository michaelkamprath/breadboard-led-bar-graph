# Breadboard LED Bar Graphs

This repository contains some KiCad projects that implement LED bar graphs made out of discrete, rectangular LEDs and designed to minimize the footprint taken on a breadboard. This is done by making the connection to the breadboard being a single row of pin headers with one pin for each LED and one pin for ground, thus making these "common cathode" LEDs. However, nothing prevents the building from inserting the LEDs in reverse and thus making these bard graphs "common anode". Current limiting resistors are added by using resistor arrays.
